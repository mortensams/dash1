# Dashboard Project Changes

## Major Updates

### 1. Test Data Generator for Unmapped Widgets

A new `TestDataService` has been added to provide realistic, dynamic test data for widgets that do not have a mapped data source. This allows widgets to show live-updating data even before configuring their data sources, making it easier to design and style widgets.

Key features:
- Auto-generates appropriate test data based on widget type
- Updates data at regular intervals to simulate real-time telemetry
- Provides realistic patterns with noise and trends
- Handles all chart types (line, bar, pie, gauge, card)

### 2. Widget Properties as Dialog

The widget properties panel has been converted to a popup dialog that appears when you select a widget:
- Frees up screen space for the dashboard
- Makes more room for property configuration
- Provides a cleaner, more focused UI for widget configuration
- Can be dismissed when not needed

### 3. Styling and UI Improvements

- Collapsible widget panel to maximize dashboard space
- Improved responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Simplified main layout to focus on dashboard content

## Implementation Details

- The `WidgetBaseComponent` now detects when a data source is not configured and automatically switches to test data mode
- The original detail panel has been removed from the main layout
- New `WidgetPropertiesDialogComponent` replaces the detail panel
- Widget selection now triggers the properties dialog
- Each widget component has been updated to use the TestDataService

## Usage Notes

- When adding a widget, it immediately shows test data
- Configure a data source in the properties dialog if you want to use real data
- Toggle the widget panel using the menu button in the toolbar to get more space
- The widget properties dialog can be accessed by clicking on any widget
- Widget style and properties changes are previewed in real-time

## Technical Notes

- The test data generator runs on a 2-second interval for smooth updates
- Test data is unique to each widget instance and persists between edits
- The widget configuration is saved automatically when closing the properties dialog
- The dashboard layout is preserved with localStorage
